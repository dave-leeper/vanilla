I opted with Vince based on his quick communication, rating and price; glad I did! \n\nLikes:\nSafe driving \nCommunication (I had to change schedule a few days out) Keep in mind he drives and text or calls maybe delayed as driving and with customers) \nClean SUV \nTalkative and super friendly \nCompetitive rate \nTakes cash, Zelle and PayPal. \nSmall business owned (it's him and one other driver at this time) \n\nDislikes:\nNone. \n\nPro tip:\nAsk Vince about his 3 week cross country motorcycle trip from 2 years ago!  ;)"

Vince called me back within 20 minutes of my submitting a request. Brendon, his driver that day, showed up on time even though my flight was early. He was explicit about details regarding where to wait, and how many minutes before his arrival. This is the kind of service you want from a top-tier company. And the price was better than those I'd used in the past. It's a solid win. Thank you Vince and Brendon!!"
